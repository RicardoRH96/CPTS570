README file for CPTS570 Homework #1 - Ricardo Rivero, WSUID: 011843796
For this implementation, I chose to get the dataset from Keras, which is presented in the same format as the data provided with the assignment, that is:
60,000 training examples consisting of 28x28 images labeled as one of 10 classes (integers in range 0-9).
10,000 testing examples consisting of 28x28 images labeled as one of 10 classes (integers in range 0-9).

#Implementation
All the code is contained within the two Jupyter notebooks Perceptron.ipynb and Multiclass_classifier.ipynb and require basically NumPy, Matplotlib and Keras.

#Execution
Software: Python 3.11.8, Jupyter
This code was tested in a Macbook Pro M2 Pro running MacOS 15.0:
> jupyter execute Perceptron.ipynb 
> jupyter execute Multiclass_classifier.ipynb

README file for CPTS570 Homework #2 - Ricardo Rivero
For this implementation, I chose to get the dataset from Scikit-learn datasets, which is exactly the same dataset as the one provided in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29.

#Implementation
All the code is contained within three Jupyter notebooks: SVM.ipynb, Kernelized_Perceptron.ipynb, and Decision_trees.ipynb and require Numpy, Matplotlib, Math, and Scikit-learn.

#Execution
Software: Python 3.11.8, Jupyter
This code was tested in a Macbook Pro M2 Pro running MacOS 15.0:
> jupyter execute SVM.ipynb
> jupyter execute Kernelized_Perceptron.ipynb 
> jupyter execute Decision_trees.ipynb

For this implementation, I am using the dataset provided by the instructor, which is then loaded and preprocessed to build the vocabulary for the Naive Bayes implementation.

#Implementation
All the code is contained within one Jupyter notebooks: NaiveBayes.ipynb and requires Numpy, Matplotlib, Math, and Scikit-learn.

#Execution
Software: Python 3.11.8, Jupyter
This code was tested in a Macbook Pro M2 Pro running MacOS 15.0:
> jupyter execute NaiveBayes.ipynb
